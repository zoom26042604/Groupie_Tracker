## 📚 About the project

This project was developed during the HangMan-Web project, by Ynov Campus. The goal was to create a HangMan game using Go templates.

We decided to add some features to the game, such as:
- 🏆 A leaderboard/Scoreboard
- 👥 A multiplayer mode
- 📜 A History of the games played

We also decided to choose a theme for the game, which is "Chalk and Blackboard", so the game is displayed as if it was written on a blackboard.

The final project repository can be founded [here](https://ytrack.learn.ynov.com/git/lalucas/hangman-web)
