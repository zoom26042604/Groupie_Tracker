## 📚 About the project

This project was developed during the Groupie-Tracker project, by Ynov Campus. The goal was to create a Website using Go templates to learn how to handle and use API.

We decided to add some features to the site, such as:
- a homePage to show ten artist at random
- a search bar to find your favorite artist
- a about to know about the project and the team

For the theme of the site we decided to take a bit of inspiration in a well known site called spotify but in thruth there are the one whom copied from us 

The final project repository can be founded [here](https://github.com/zoom26042604/Groupie_Tracker)

And our presentation for the project can be found [here](https://www.canva.com/design/DAGgBIMDB50/dKuQRZQub2fcFYP97AXzcg/edit?utm_content=DAGgBIMDB50&utm_campaign=designshare&utm_medium=link2&utm_source=sharebutton)
